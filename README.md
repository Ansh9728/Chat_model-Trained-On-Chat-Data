# Chat_model-Trained-On-Chat-Data

In that Project Basically Develop a chat model using Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a conversation between two users based on a provided conversational chat data.. The LLM will be trained on a conversation chat history, allowing it to detect and mimic the style and tone of one of the users. The goal is to create a conversational AI system where one person can interact with the model, representing one side of the conversation, and receive responses that resemble the other user's style and tone.
I have used the LLam2 model in quantization format to load the large model into the smaller size which will run freely on the colab free version I have used the 4 bit quantization with utilization of hugging face hub and peft library to quantization and i used the hugging face hub to get the LLama2 model
